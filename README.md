# Professional-README-Generator---Challenge-9

### Description

Given starter code, I've restructured a simple README.md Generator application that allows a user to place data into a README.md template. I have done this by creating multiple JavaScript files that are linked to each other mainly using node.js and using inquirer and util packages to dynamically create the template.
